the API is not stable yet. It will be stabilized soon and some real docs will follow ;)

## Config

The config file should be `config.{yml,json,ini,...}` (all formats provided by https://github.com/spf13/viper#what-is-viper) and it is expected in `/etc/shush` or in the same location as shush executable.

The config file location may also be set as param `./shush -confFile conf-test.yml`
